# Agent instructions

This file provides guidance to agentic LLM tooling when working with code in this
repository.

## What this is

A static site for the 2026 FIFA World Cup knockout stage: side-by-side match
comparison pages plus a bracket index. Python generators run on 3.11+ (for
`tomllib`). Output is committed to the repo and served via GitHub Pages at
`compare/index.html`.

This is a toy project with a single developer; expect it to sit idle for a few
years at a stretch (between the men's and women's World Cups). Optimize for "easy
to pick back up cold," not for breadth of contributors or runtime portability —
there is no CI and nothing runs this code but its author, on a machine with `uv`.

## Commands

```sh
python3 build.py                          # regenerate compare/ from data/ (the build)
python3 scripts/apply_rosters.py          # write rosters into teams/*.html squad blocks
uv run python scripts/extract_teams.py    # re-scaffold data/teams.toml from teams/*.html
uv run ruff format <files>                # format (line-length 99, single quotes; see pyproject.toml)
uv run ruff check <files>                 # lint
uv run ty check                           # type-check
uv run pytest                             # run the test suite (tests/)
```

`build.py` and `apply_rosters.py` are stdlib-only and run under plain `python3`.
Everything else needs the `[dependency-groups]` dev group and so runs via `uv
run`: `extract_teams.py` parses HTML with `beautifulsoup4`/`lxml`, and the tooling
(`ruff`/`ty`/`pytest`) lives there too. `uv.lock` is committed so the whole set
resolves identically across machines. (`uv run python …` works for the
stdlib-only scripts as well; bare `python3` is just the no-uv fallback for them.)

Tests live in `tests/` and cover only the logic ty can't see and the
data-quality systems don't own: the apply_rosters↔extract_teams HTML contract,
`parse_kickoff`/`validate` branching, and the `FLAG_CODES` completeness
invariant. They deliberately do *not* assert exact rendered HTML (treat
`compare/` as compiled output to spot-check) or roster *data* accuracy. Beyond
that, validation is built into the generators: they `sys.exit` with a `<file>:
error:` message on bad/missing data rather than producing broken pages. After a
build, open `compare/index.html` in a browser to verify.

## The data flow (the key thing to understand)

The pipeline runs in a specific order because each stage's *output is the next
stage's input*, and `teams/*.html` is both a hand-authored source AND a generated
artifact depending on the stage:

```text
data/rosters/<slug>.toml  ──apply_rosters.py──►  teams/<slug>.html  (squad block rewritten in place)
teams/<slug>.html         ──extract_teams.py──►  data/teams.toml    (stats + squads scaffolded out)
data/teams.toml + data/rounds/*.toml  ──build.py──►  compare/*.html + compare/index.html
```

So the full refresh sequence after editing a roster is:

```sh
python3 scripts/apply_rosters.py && uv run python scripts/extract_teams.py && python3 build.py
```

Ownership rules that are easy to get wrong:

- **`build.py` owns `compare/`** — it clears and regenerates every `.html` there
  on each run. Never hand-edit files in `compare/`; edit the generator or the
  source TOML instead.
- **`teams/*.html` is hand-authored**, except the squad block (`<div
  class="squad-head">…</table>`) and the "Squad avg age" factstrip, which
  `apply_rosters.py` rewrites via regex. Hero, blurb, coach, and footer are left
  untouched. The script is idempotent.
- **`data/teams.toml` is a hand-editable artifact.** `extract_teams.py` only
  *scaffolds* it from the HTML; `build.py` never rewrites it. Re-run
  `extract_teams.py` only to re-scaffold, and spot-check the result.
- Team identity is a **slug** (the `teams/<slug>.html` stem), used as the TOML
  table key and referenced by `home`/`away` in round files. Keeping slugs
  consistent across all three layers is what holds the pipeline together.

When reviewing a diff, focus on the non-HTML sources (`build.py`, `scripts/*.py`,
`assets/*.js`, `style.css`, the TOML data) — the bulk of any diff is `compare/`
and the squad blocks in `teams/*.html`, which are essentially compiled output and
will show the same change repeated across dozens of files. Spot-check the rendered
output rather than reviewing it file by file; only read it closely when the change
is specifically about generated markup or layout.

## build.py specifics

- `FLAG_CODES` maps each team slug → flag-icons code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2). It must
  contain every team in the bracket; `flag()` calls `die()` on any unmapped slug,
  so the build fails loudly. England uses `gb-eng` (St George's Cross), not `gb`.
- `CONF_VARS_STYLE` is an inline `:root` block emitted into every generated
  `<head>` *before* the external stylesheet, so confederation accent colors are
  defined on first paint (avoids a load-time blue flash). Keep it in sync with
  the `:root` block in `style.css`. The hand-authored `teams/*.html` and root
  `index.html` carry their own copy of this block — if you change the
  confederation palette, update all of: `style.css`, `build.py`'s
  `CONF_VARS_STYLE`, and every page that inlines it.
- `FLAG_ICONS_LINK` loads flag-icons from the CDN as a parallel `<link>` in every
  `<head>`. Do **not** move it back to an `@import` in `style.css`: an `@import`
  serializes the CDN fetch ahead of `style.css`'s own rules, delaying the
  `:root{--conf-*}` block and reintroducing the load-time flash on a slow CDN.
  The hand-authored `teams/*.html` and root `index.html` carry their own copy of
  this `<link>`; bump the version in all of them plus `build.py` together.
- Confederation accent colors are driven by inline `style="--accent:var(--conf-<conf>)"`
  attributes plus the `--conf-*` CSS vars; `accent()`/`conf_label()` produce them.
- `times.js` upgrades each `<time class="kickoff">` element to the viewer's local
  zone at runtime; the server-rendered text is the venue-local no-JS fallback.

## Conventions

- Code style is enforced by ruff (`pyproject.toml`): 99-column lines, single
  quotes for regular strings, double quotes preserved for docstrings.
- Keep `build.py` and `apply_rosters.py` stdlib-only so the build proper stays
  runnable under bare `python3`. Other scripts may use the dev-group deps:
  `extract_teams.py` uses `beautifulsoup4`/`lxml` to parse the team HTML (it's a
  read-only scaffolder, where a parser beats brittle regex; don't reach for one
  in `apply_rosters.py`, which surgically *rewrites* HTML in place and would be
  mangled by a parser's normalization). Add a dep only when it clearly pays for
  itself — this is a small, rarely-touched project.
- Roster TOML (`data/rosters/<slug>.toml`) expects exactly 26 players, unique
  shirt numbers, exactly one `captain = true`, and `pos` in GK/DF/MF/FW;
  `apply_rosters.py` warns (⚠) on violations rather than failing.
- Roster data is researched and validated against Wikipedia's 2026 FIFA World
  Cup squads (verify each player, shirt number, and the full 26-man list).

## Before committing

- Run `ruff check --fix` (then `ruff format`) to lint and auto-fix.
- Run `ty check` after any large change, and before committing Python changes.
- Run `rumdl fmt` on touched Markdown files (config in `.rumdl.toml`).
- Write commit messages in Tim Pope style: a ~50-char capitalized summary in the
  imperative mood ("Add flag icons", not "Added"/"Adds"). One difference, always
  use trailing period [rationale: it indicates commit message not truncated]. If
  a body is warranted, separate it with a blank line and wrap at 72 columns,
  explaining *what* and *why* rather than *how*. Omit the body entirely for
  obvious/self-explanatory changes — a good summary line is often enough.
